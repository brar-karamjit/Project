# Project

Full-Stack Developer project

Hi, My name is karamjit, thanks for visiting my repository
This project utilises multiple javascript librariries such as TweenMax,
ScrollMagic, jquery and for navbar I have used CSS library bootstrap.

At the very top you can see an animation which is controlled by scroll,
following that there is particles-js library for background and my name 
is being written using a typewriter effect created using CSS.

There are two apps in the project, first App takes input from user and fetches
result from GIPHY.com using their API. This App uses Javacript to override
the existing media library with the Library received via fetch command (in JSON format), 
 and unwraps that data.  For more data you can refer to console
